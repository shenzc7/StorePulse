# The Soul of StorePulse

This folder contains everything you need to own, understand, defend, and use StorePulse.

## 1. For You (The Owner)
*   **[PROJECT_BIBLE.md](PROJECT_BIBLE.md)**: The "Super Plain English" guide. Read this first. It explains the "Why" and "How" without complex jargon. It's your script for explaining the project to a friend or a non-tech boss.

## 2. For The Defense (The Viva)
*   **[VIVA_DEFENSE_GUIDE.md](VIVA_DEFENSE_GUIDE.md)**: The "Academic Weapon". Use this for your panel presentation. It has the math equations, architecture diagrams, and answers to difficult questions like "Why didn't you use LSTM?".

## 3. For The Proof (The Specs)
*   **[TECHNICAL_REFERENCE.md](TECHNICAL_REFERENCE.md)**: The "Engineering Evidence". It lists every API endpoint and Database table. Show this if they ask "Did you actually build the backend?".

## 4. For The User (The Client)
*   **[User_Manual.pdf](User_Manual.pdf)**: The "Premium Manual". A professionally designed PDF guide for the end-user (Store Manager).
*   **[User_Manual.md](User_Manual.md)**: The source text for the manual.

*Everything in this folder represents the intellectual core of the project.*
